Asteroid Impact Risk Analysis 
Overview
This project aims to analyze asteroid risks by predicting whether an asteroid is hazardous and estimating its potential impact severity. Using NASAâ€™s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset, we apply deep learning and statistical simulations to assess the probability and consequences of asteroid impacts.

Objectives
1. Classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous using deep learning
2. Predict impact severity (in megatons) based on asteroid characteristics
3. Simulate asteroid risks using Monte Carlo methods for probabilistic analysis

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing â€“ Clean and transform asteroid data, including velocity conversion and impact energy estimation.
2. Classification Model â€“ A neural network predicts whether an asteroid is hazardous.
3. Regression Model â€“ Another model estimates the impact energy of an asteroid collision.
4. Monte Carlo Simulation â€“ Thousands of asteroid impact scenarios are simulated to estimate overall risk.

Key Insights
ðŸ”¹ The classification model helps identify potentially dangerous asteroids.
ðŸ”¹ The regression model predicts the energy release of a potential impact.
ðŸ”¹ Simulations provide a statistical estimate of expected annual impact damage.

These results can assist space agencies in risk assessment and disaster preparedness.

Future Improvements
ðŸ”¸ Integrate real-time asteroid tracking via NASAâ€™s API.
ðŸ”¸ Enhance models with additional features like orbital trajectory.
ðŸ”¸ Develop an interactive web dashboard for asteroid risk visualization.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AI and deep learning can be used for asteroid hazard prediction and impact risk analysis. By continuously improving these models, we can contribute to planetary defense and space research.
